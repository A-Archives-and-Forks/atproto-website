# OAuth for AT Protocol application developers

This guide is aimed at developers building applications on AT Protocol.

If you're building your own protocol implementation or OAuth Client SDK, the more detailed [specification](/specs/oauth) or advanced [OAuth client implementation guide](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/oauth-client) may be more appropriate.

## What *is* OAuth?

Without OAuth, if you (as a user) wanted to authorize a 3rd party app to access your account, your only option would be to type your account password into that app. This is bad for all sorts of reasons, the first being that a 3rd party app gets to see your password. The app is granted *full* access to your whole account, even if the app only needed partial access. The only way to revoke that access would be to change your password.

OAuth is a family of open specifications for doing secure Authorization, i.e. solving the problem of not handing out passwords to 3rd party apps, not giving those apps overly broad account access, and being able to manage and revoke that access later.

## How is OAuth Different in AT Protocol?

ATProto [specifies](/specs/oauth) a particular "profile" of the OAuth standards, using [OAuth 2.1](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html) as the foundation.

There are a couple of details that might catch you off guard if you're used to using other OAuth systems.

- **Migration**: ATProto users can migrate their accounts between servers ([PDSes](guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server)) over time. To facilitate this ATProto has a flexible [Identity](/guides/identity) layer, which allows usernames ([handles](/specs/handle)) to be resolved to a static user ID ([DID](/specs/did)), which in turn can be resolved to locate the user's PDS. When a user logs in to an app, the OAuth client dynamically resolves these relationships.

- **Client IDs**: In other OAuth ecosystems, it is often necessary for client apps to pre-register themselves with the resource server. This is not viable in a decentralized system (with many clients and many resource servers), so ATProto addresses this using [Client ID Metadata Documents](/specs/oauth#client-id-metadata-document).

<Note>
You may see "[App Passwords](/specs/xrpc#app-passwords)" referenced in older guides and apps. These existed as an interim solution before OAuth was implemented, and OAuth is the recommended solution for all apps going forwards.

## OAuth SDKs

The inner workings of OAuth can be fiddly, but the good news is that weâ€™ve done our best to abstract it away via client SDKs, so you can focus on your app.

### TypeScript

- [@atproto/oauth-client-browser](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/oauth/oauth-client-browser) ([npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-browser)) - Suitable for front-end-only applications (e.g. SPAs).
- [@atproto/oauth-client-node](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/oauth/oauth-client-node) ([npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-node)) - Suitable for Electron desktop apps or server-side deployments.
- [@atproto/oauth-client-expo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/oauth/oauth-client-expo) ([npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-expo)) - For use in React Native projects (e.g. mobile apps)
- [@atproto/oauth-client](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/oauth/oauth-client) ([npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client)) (This is the core implementation on which the above three libraries depend)

### Go

- [Indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/tree/main/atproto/auth/oauth) ([Online API Docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/atproto/auth/oauth)) - Suitable for native apps or server-side deployments

## ATProto OAuth Example Apps

These simple example apps all demonstrate usage of their respective SDKs.

| Example App | Language | SDK | Architecture | Confidential Client? | Localhost development client ID? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [cookbook/oauth-react-native-expo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/oauth-react-native-expo) | TypeScript | @atproto/oauth-client-expo | Mobile App (no backend) | No | No (requires hosted client metadata) |
| [cookbook/vanillajs-oauth-web-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/vanillajs-oauth-web-app) | JavaScript | @atproto/oauth-client-browser | Web SPA (no backend) | No | Optionally |
| [cookbook/go-oauth-web-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/go-oauth-web-app) | Go | indigo | Web BFF | Optionally | Optionally |
| [cookbook/go-oauth-cli-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/go-oauth-cli-app) | Go | indigo | Native CLI | No | No (requires hosted client metadata) |
| [cookbook/python-oauth-web-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/python-oauth-web-app) | Python | None | Web BFF | Optionally | Optionally |

<Note>
The Python example does not use an SDK! It may be useful as reference when building an OAuth SDK from scratch, alongside the advanced [OAuth client implementation guide](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/oauth-client)
